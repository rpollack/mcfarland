## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

get_game_results <- function(team, year) {
  url <- glue("https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/{team}/{year}-schedule-scores.shtml")

  read_html(url) %>%
    html_elements(css = "#all_team_schedule") %>%
    html_table() %>%
    pluck(1) %>%
    select(game_number = `Gm#`, result = `W/L`, streak = Streak) %>%
    
    # remove header rows
    filter(streak != "Streak") %>%
    mutate(
      type = str_extract(result, "W|L"),
      length = str_length(streak),
      year = year,
      team = team
    ) 
}


```

```{r}

# build list of teams and years. uses proper abbreviations. e.g. TBR for 2008 and after; TBD in years prior. 




streak_data <-
  expand_grid(team = c("BAL", "CLE", "DET", "NYY"), year = 1954:2022) %>%
  pmap_dfr(get_game_results) %>%
   # identify nonconsecutive streaks in a season. this prevents 11 game streaks from also counting as streaks of 10, 9. 8, etc. games
  mutate(consec = case_when(
    row_number() == 1 ~ TRUE,
    TRUE ~ if_else(type == lag(type), TRUE, FALSE))
  ) %>%
  filter(consec != lead(consec),
         length >= 4) %>%         # we only care about streaks of 4 or more games. 
  unite(streak_type, type, length, sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%
  count(year, streak_type, name = "num_streaks") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  complete(year, streak_type, fill = list(num_streaks = 0)) 
  
  


```

```{r, fig.height=3}
streak_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.Date(glue("{year}-01-01"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, num_streaks, group = streak_type, fill = streak_type, color = streak_type)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) + geom_path() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(streak_type)) +
  scale_x_date()
```


get_game_results(2017) %>%
  
  %>%
  group_by(year, team) %>%
  
  # TODO: fix streak_prob; it should be divided by 162 or something else. 
  mutate(streak_prob = num_streaks / sum(num_streaks)) %>%
  arrange(desc(streak_prob))
    
    
```


``` {r} 

%>%
  

  
  
```


there are a couple ways we can measure this:

max streak length

probability of n-game winning streak occurring. ex: 2019 Rays had multiple 6 game winning streaks. 1993 Orioles had 3 separate 8 game winning streaks, a 9 game win streak, a 10 game win streak, and an 8 game losing streak. 
^^^ do this first, then restrict the data to what's below:

I also think we want to retain the longest of each streak type.e.g. if an 8 game win streak stops there, we want to count 8. however if it becomes an 11 game winning streak, we want to stop it at 11. the 8 shouldn't also count.



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
