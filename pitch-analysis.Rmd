who is throwing pitches they shouldn't? or who needs to re-sequence, or adjust mechanics/spin/velo/etc. of a certain pitch?

look for pitchers to throw a high % of pitch types, in certain zones, to certain-handed batters, that get smacked for a high xWOBA

get data

```{r}

    game_type %in% c("R", "F", "D", "L", "W"), # ignore spring training, etc. games
    zone != 0 # ignore invalid strikezone data
