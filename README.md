## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```r
# Required R packages
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "dplyr", "readr", "purrr", "stringr",
  "httr", "jsonlite", "bslib", "commonmark", 
  "shinybusy", "ggplot2", "htmltools", "digest",
  "tidyverse", "baseballr", "stringi", "janitor"
))
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for AI analysis
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

### Running the Application

#### Local Development
```r
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leadRboard.git
cd leadRboard

# Run the Shiny app
shiny::runApp("app/app.R")
```

#### Data Refresh
```r
# Manual data refresh (or use GitHub Actions)
source("refresh_data.R")
```

## Data Pipeline

### Automated Daily Refresh
The application uses GitHub Actions to automatically refresh data daily at 6 AM EST:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/refresh-data.yml
name: Daily Baseball Data Refresh
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 11 * * *'  # 6 AM EST
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
```

### Data Processing
1. **Hitter Metrics**: AVG, OBP, SLG, K%, BB%, Barrel%, BABIP, wOBA, xwOBA
2. **Pitcher Metrics**: ERA, xERA, K%, BB%, CSW%, Barrel%, BABIP, LOB%
3. **Difference Calculation**: Current year vs. 3-year historical average
4. **Player Lookup**: Unified table with compound IDs for dual-role players

## API Usage & Caching

### Smart Caching System
- **Memory-based caching**: Stores API responses for 1 hour
- **Cache size management**: Automatically maintains 25-50 recent entries
- **Performance tracking**: Monitors cache hits vs. API calls
- **Cost optimization**: Reduces OpenAI API usage significantly

### Analysis Generation
The AI analysis incorporates:
- **Skill vs. Luck Indicators**: Distinguishes sustainable performance changes
- **Age Considerations**: Adjusts expectations based on player age
- **Sample Size Awareness**: Accounts for statistical significance
- **Position-specific Insights**: Tailored analysis for SP/RP pitchers

## Usage Examples

### Basic Player Analysis
1. Select a player from the dropdown
2. Choose an analysis personality/vibe
3. View AI-generated analysis with trend visualization

### Understanding the Analysis
- **Green trends**: Generally positive performance indicators
- **Statistical significance**: Larger sample sizes = more reliable trends
- **Luck indicators**: BABIP, LOB%, ERA-xERA gaps highlight variance
- **Skill indicators**: K%, BB%, Barrel% show true talent changes
