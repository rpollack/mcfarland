## Why you'll love it
- **Hitters and pitchers**: size up both sides of the plate
- **Year-over-year context**: compares 2025 numbers to 2022–2024 averages
- **Smart metrics**: highlights BABIP, xwOBA, barrel rate and more to separate skill from luck
- **Future peeks**: offers rest-of-season outlooks based on recent trends

### Analysis engine
- Natural-language writeups generated by a language model
- Memory-based caching for fast, cost-conscious responses

## Get started
### Prerequisites
```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "dplyr", "readr", "purrr", "stringr",
  "httr", "jsonlite", "bslib", "commonmark",
  "shinybusy", "ggplot2", "htmltools", "digest",
  "tidyverse", "baseballr", "stringi", "janitor"
))
```

### Environment variables
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Run the app locally

git clone https://github.com/your-username/leadRboard.git
cd leadRboard
shiny::runApp("app/app.R")
```

### Refresh the data
```r
source("refresh_data.R")
```

## Data pipeline
### Automated daily refresh
GitHub Actions pulls fresh stats every morning at 6 AM EST.

### Data processing
1. Hitter metrics: AVG, OBP, SLG, K%, BB%, Barrel%, BABIP, wOBA, xwOBA
2. Pitcher metrics: ERA, xERA, K%, BB%, CSW%, Barrel%, BABIP, LOB%
3. Difference calculation: current year vs three-year average
4. Player lookup table for dual-role players
